**A small language model that composes Hindustani ragas, trained on a MacBook with reinforcement learning where the raga's grammar is the reward.**

**Live site: [ragaz-black.vercel.app](https://ragaz-black.vercel.app/)**: listen to its pieces, play the instruments, compose and get scored by the same reward that trained it.

---

## What it is

Qwen3-0.6B, adapted with LoRA, learns to write ragas in sargam notation (`S R G P | G R S - | …`) from nothing but the raga's name. A verifier scores every piece against the raga's rules and against measurements of real concert singers; GRPO pushes the model toward whatever scores higher. Supervised fine-tuning fills in the facts reinforcement learning cannot discover on its own.

Ragas: **Bhupali, Yaman, Malkauns, Deshkar** (Deshkar shares Bhupali's five notes; only emphasis and movement tell them apart).

## What we found

| | |
|---|---|
| **Every reward gets hacked.** | One note repeated, octave hopping, copying the prompt's example, 32-bar loops, one answer for every raga, bars chopped to 1–3 beats. Each was real, each looked like progress in the curves, and each led to a new term. The lesson: **hard rules must multiply**; anything in a weighted sum gets traded away. |
| **RL can't teach a fact.** | Asked for Malkauns by name, the model never stumbled on its notes, so every attempt scored zero for 100 steps. Fine-tuning on a few hundred good examples fixed it in 30 steps (0.00 → 0.82). |
| **Rules aren't music.** | Trained on textbook rules (v1), the model rested on Sa 7–13% of the time; real singers do 35–38%. Re-grounding the reward in 30 CompMusic concert recordings (v2) brought it to 36% / 21% / 39%. |
| **Closer to performance (v5e).** | 16-bar pieces with a sthayi → antara arc; ~34% of time in the upper octave (real singers 19–46%; v4: 0%); uneven runs and holds (duration CV 1.24, real 1.47; v4 0.40); median note 0.21 s (real 0.21 s). |

The full experiment log, run by run, is in the project notes (`ideas/ragaz/experiments.md` in the parent workspace).

## How it works

```
prompt ("Compose a raga: Bhupali")
  → Qwen3-0.6B + LoRA (MLX)          writes 8–16 bars of sargam
  → verifier (src/ragaz/verify.py)    rules × real-music style = reward in [0, 1]
  → GRPO                              8 answers per prompt; advantage = (r − group mean) / std
```

**The reward (v5).** Hard gates multiply; style is a weighted sum; rhythm scales the whole:

```
reward = format · purity · beats² · variety · length
         · (0.15 tala + 0.15 rank + 0.15 pakad + 0.30 phrases + 0.10 motion + 0.15 register)   [+ arc for 16+ bars]
         · (0.4 + 0.6 · rhythm)
```

- **Rules:** notes allowed in the raga, 4 beats per bar, whole Teentaal cycles, ending on Sa or a resting note, the most important notes in the right rank, the signature phrase (pakad).
- **Measured from real singers** (CompMusic pitch tracks, held-out recordings for evaluation): 4-note phrases mined per raga, melodic step sizes, time per octave (register), and rhythm shape.
- **Training recipe:** GRPO with the rules in the prompt → distil its good pieces → SFT on name-only prompts → GRPO with the real-music reward → 16-bar SFT → GRPO (v5e).

**The voices.** Notation is rendered with glides and wavers learned from real singers' pitch curves (`expression.py`), then synthesised either as a flute or with a **DDSP voice** (Engel et al., 2020) trained on 65 minutes of separately miked vocal tracks of 12 women singers from Saraga Carnatic. The DDSP model is given only pitch and loudness, so every note it sings is the composer's.

## Quick start

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest -q

uv run ragaz ragas                                           # the raga rules
uv run ragaz verify examples/yaman.txt --raga yaman          # score a piece
uv run ragaz render examples/yaman.txt --raga yaman -o out/yaman.wav --expressive --play
uv run --extra voice ragaz render out/v5e-yaman.txt --raga yaman --tempo 90 --voice vocal -o out/yaman-vocal.wav

uv run ragaz baseline …                                      # sample an untrained model and score it
uv run ragaz train configs/v5e-long-grpo.yaml                # GRPO (LoRA, MLX)
uv run ragaz distill …  /  uv run ragaz sft configs/v5-sft-long.yaml
```

Training is memory-guarded (`watchdog.py`): runs stay around 3–5 GB on a 24 GB M4 Pro.

**Data (fetched, not committed):**
```bash
uv run python scripts/fetch_compmusic.py      # CompMusic raga features (pitch tracks + tonic), HTTP range reads
uv run python -m ragaz.realprofile            # → data/real_profiles.json (the real-music reward)
uv run python -m ragaz.expression             # → data/expression.json (glides and wavers)
uv run python scripts/fetch_vocal.py          # Saraga vocal stems
uv run --extra voice python -m ragaz.ddsp prepare vocal
uv run --extra voice python -m ragaz.ddsp train 6000 vocal
```

## Notation

```
S R G M P D N     shuddh (M = tivra Ma)        .S  lower octave
r g m d n         komal  (m = shuddh Ma)       S'  upper octave
-                 hold one more beat           |   bar line (or newline)
GR                two notes in one beat
```
One Teentaal cycle is 4 bars of 4 beats: `G R S .D | S R G - | P G D P | G R S - |`
